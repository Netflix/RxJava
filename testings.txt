rx.internal.operators.OperatorZip - Broken reference is probably OK, but references are all over. Test this. May also not really kill cycle, but I think it does.

----- RUN 3:20pm

rx.internal.operators.OperatorTake - Looks to be a self contained loop
OperatorTakeLast - Breaks cycle, but worried reference will get dropped somewhere
OperatorTakeLastTimed - Breaks cycle, but worried about getting dropped

rx.internal.operators.OperatorReplay - Different than original! Bad logic on last one. Direct cycle and break on this.
rx.internal.operators.OperatorObserveOn - Ignore changes. Bad.
rx.internal.operators.OperatorMerge - Original had extra "Weak", which looks dangerous at best, and unnecessary
rx.internal.operators.OperatorGroupBy - Weak for obvious big, but not "state". Test this.
